A small, dependency-free KDE Plasma 6 applet that shows your API balance and
usage — DeepSeek, Kimi Code and Z.ai — in the panel, with a detailed popup.

- **Panel:** an icon plus the numbers you check in the settings — any mix of
  DeepSeek, Kimi and Z.ai metrics, side by side; nothing checked means just
  the icon.
- **Popup:** balance, today/period/lifetime spend, an estimated "days left",
  in/out/cached tokens and request counts, a daily-spend sparkline and a
  per-API-key breakdown.
- **Quota reminders:** desktop notifications (via `notify-send`) cover both a
  weekly quota within a day of resetting with more than 20% unused —
  suggesting the per-day pace that would spend it — and a twice-daily digest
  of the current usage at times you set. Every reminder has its own switch
  and knobs in the settings.
- **Secrets live in KWallet**, never in the widget's configuration file.
- **No runtime dependencies** beyond Plasma and Qt: network access is QML
  `XMLHttpRequest`, parsing is plain JavaScript, and KWallet is reached through
  `kwallet-query`.

As a panel chip — the icon, the number you choose, and the peak/off-peak dot:

## Install

```sh
./install.sh            # install or upgrade for the current user
./install.sh --pack     # write ai-usage.plasmoid for distribution
./install.sh --uninstall
```

Then add **DeepSeek Usage** to a panel or the desktop. Right-click the widget →
_Configure…_ to add your credentials.

## Credentials

Two different credentials exist, and they are not interchangeable.

|                 | API key                                  | Session token                                                     |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Where to get it | <https://platform.deepseek.com/api_keys> | the value the platform site keeps after you log in                |
| Scope           | your account's API access                | **full account access**, including creating and deleting API keys |
| Gives you       | balance only                             | balance, lifetime spend and usage history                         |
| Stored as       | `deepseek-api-key` in KWallet            | `deepseek-session-token` in KWallet                               |

### How to get the session token

1. Log in to <https://platform.deepseek.com> in your browser.
2. Open Developer Tools (F12, or ⌥⌘I on macOS).
3. Open the **Application** tab (**Storage** in Firefox) → **Local Storage** → `https://platform.deepseek.com`.
4. Find the key named `userToken` and copy **only the token inside it**. The entry is a JSON object — `{"value":"…","__version":"0"}` — and the session token is just the string after `value:`.

> [!TIP]
> Copying the whole entry is the usual mistake, and it fails with `Authorization Failed (invalid token)`, because the request then carries `{"value":…}` where a token belongs. The widget unwraps it either way, so pasting the entry, a quoted copy, or a whole `Bearer …` header all still work.

Both are written to KWallet (wallet `kdewallet`, folder `Plasma`) and read back
with `kwallet-query`. The API key alone is enough for the balance; adding the
session token enables the usage sections. If the session token stops working
the widget falls back to the balance and tells you why.

> [!WARNING]
> The session token is as powerful as your password. Treat it like one, and
> remove it from KWallet if you stop using rich mode.

### Kimi Code (optional)

The widget can also show your [Kimi Code](https://www.kimi.com/coding) (Coding
Plan) usage. Store a Kimi Code key as `kimi-api-key` in the same KWallet folder
(or paste it on the widget's settings page) and the popup gains a **Kimi Code**
section: the weekly quota and each per-model limit, with used / limit, percent
and the reset time. The panel can show _Kimi weekly usage_ or _Kimi quota left_
as its number.

Two things that do not work, because they are the usual mistakes:

- a key from the Kimi Open Platform (`sk-…` from
  `platform.moonshot.cn`/`api.moonshot.cn`) — this reads the **Coding Plan**
  API, which wants a `sk-kimi-…` key and answers Open Platform keys with 401;
- the Open Platform base URL — the widget defaults to
  `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` and the base URL is only a setting for
  proxies, not for switching to `api.moonshot.cn`.

### Z.ai (optional)

The widget can also show your [Z.ai](https://z.ai) (GLM Coding Plan) usage.
Store a Z.ai API key as `zai-api-key` in the same KWallet folder (or paste it
on the widget's settings page) and the popup gains a **Z.ai** section: the
quota windows the monitor API reports — the 5-hour token window, the weekly
quota and the monthly tool quota, each with its percentage and reset time —
plus the last 7 and 30 days of tokens and requests. The panel can show
_Z.ai 5-hour usage_ or _Z.ai quota left_ as its number.

## Data sources

The widget is a hybrid because DeepSeek exposes two unrelated APIs.

**Official API** (`api.deepseek.com`) — API-key authenticated, documented,
reliable, but it only reports the balance:

```
GET https://api.deepseek.com/user/balance
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```

**Platform API** (`platform.deepseek.com/api/v0`) — the backend behind the web
usage page. It is session authenticated and **undocumented**, so it can change
at any time:

```
GET /users/get_user_summary
GET /usage/by_api_key/amount?start=&end=&tz=
GET /usage/by_api_key/cost?start=&end=&tz=
authorization: Bearer <SESSION_TOKEN>
```

Two quirks worth knowing:

- The platform API answers **HTTP 200 even for auth failures**, putting the
  real status in the JSON body (`{"code":40003,...}`). The widget therefore
  classifies results from the payload, never from the HTTP status.
- Cost and token payloads nest their series differently (`data.biz_data.data[]
.series[]` for cost, `data.biz_data.series[]` for tokens).

Because there is no documented "usage" endpoint, the spend figures and the
"estimated days left" value are **derived** from this API and are labelled as
such in the popup.

**Kimi Code API** (`api.kimi.com/coding/v1`) — the same `usages` endpoint the
Kimi CLI reads. API-key authenticated, undocumented, and — unlike the DeepSeek
platform above — it classifies failures with real HTTP status codes:

```
GET https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1/usages
Authorization: Bearer <KIMI_CODE_KEY>
```

The payload is a `data[]` list of quotas (`model_name: "all"` is the weekly
one); an older `usage`/`limits` shape is also understood, as is the singular
`/usage` path the CLI falls back to.

**Z.ai monitor API** (`api.z.ai`) — the endpoints behind the Z.ai usage page.
API-key authenticated (tried as a bare `Authorization` value first, `Bearer` on
retry) and undocumented; failures are real HTTP status codes:

```
GET https://api.z.ai/api/monitor/usage/quota/limit
GET https://api.z.ai/api/monitor/usage/model-usage?startTime=&endTime=
```

`quota/limit` answers the quota rows: two `TOKENS_LIMIT` entries that carry
only a percentage and a `nextResetTime` (the 5-hour and weekly token windows),
and a `TIME_LIMIT` entry whose `usage` **is** the limit and whose
`currentValue` is the used count (the monthly tool quota). `model-usage` takes
`YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` local-time windows and answers a `totalUsage` object;
the widget asks for the last 7 and 30 days.

## Configuration

| Setting          | Default                          | Meaning                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Refresh interval | 300 s                            | how often to poll (minimum 30 s)                                                           |
| Panel shows      | Balance                          | the checked metrics, shown side by side (nothing checked: icon only)                       |
| Cost period      | 30 days                          | window for the period totals and the sparkline                                             |
| Hide all amounts | off                              | replace every amount on screen with bullets                                                |
| Kimi base URL    | `https://api.kimi.com/coding/v1` | endpoint for the Kimi Code usage API (for proxies; not for switching to `api.moonshot.cn`) |
| Z.ai base URL    | `https://api.z.ai`               | endpoint for the Z.ai monitor API (for proxies)                                            |

The per-key breakdown lists API key **names** only. The masked key id that the
platform reports is deliberately never rendered anywhere.

## Peak and off-peak pricing

DeepSeek charges half price outside its peak hours, so the widget shows which
rate is in effect: a small dot on the panel chip, and the state plus the time
left in it in the popup and tooltip.

- **green** — off-peak: you are paying the discounted rate
- **red** — peak: you are paying full price
- **neutral** — unknown: see below

The schedule is [documented](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/quick_start/pricing)
as _01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC, Monday to Friday, excluding Chinese public
holidays_; all other hours are off-peak, including weekends and holidays in full.

### Why it can say "Unknown"

The weekday and time-of-day part of that rule is exact and always applies. The
holiday exception is different: the State Council publishes the following year's
dates only in November or December and can revise them, so it is data that has to
be maintained by hand and cannot be derived.

The widget therefore will not guess. `CHINESE_HOLIDAYS` in
`contents/ui/js/peak.js` holds the published schedule, block by block, for the
years that have been announced:

```js
addRange("2026-10-01", "2026-10-07"); // National Day
```

When asked about a year the table does not cover, the state is reported as
**Unknown** rather than assuming those days are ordinary working days — assuming
that would report peak while DeepSeek was charging the off-peak rate. Estimated
dates must not be added either, for the same reason in the other direction: a
wrong entry would claim a discount that does not exist.

### Keeping it current

`node --test tests/peak.test.mjs` includes a deliberate maintenance alarm: it
**fails once the table no longer covers the current year**, and also fails if any
covered year looks half-filled. Add the newly published year with `addRange()`
and the tests go green again. Announced in November/December for the following
year, so that is the once-a-year chore.

## Development

The parsing, formatting and KWallet command logic live in plain JavaScript
modules under `contents/ui/js/` so they can be tested without a Plasma session:

```sh
node --test tests/api.test.mjs tests/format.test.mjs tests/wallet.test.mjs
```

`tests/mock-platform-server.mjs` serves the recorded payload shapes of the
platform API, which is the only way to exercise rich mode without live
credentials. Point `PLATFORM_BASE` in `contents/ui/js/api.js` at
`http://127.0.0.1:8731/api/v0` while you test, then put it back.

Static checks for the QML side:

```sh
qmllint contents/ui/*.qml contents/config/config.qml
```

Rendering the applet once per locale, to spot mojibake or text that overflows
the popup (Hindi and Russian run much longer than English):

```sh
tests/capture-locales.sh /tmp/shots zh_CN ru_RU hi_IN
```

### Continuous integration

The checks above run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`), on a stock Ubuntu
runner and without Plasma: `node --test`, `./translate/build.sh --check`,
a QML syntax check with `qmllint`, and `./install.sh --pack` to prove the
distribution archive still builds. `qmllint` on Qt 6 resolves no imports, so it
needs no KDE packages, which is what makes that job possible at all.

One workflow does not run on push. `.github/workflows/holiday-alarm.yml` runs
`tests/peak.test.mjs` on the first of every month, because that file contains a
deliberate alarm: it fails once the Chinese-holiday table stops covering the
current year, and the State Council only publishes the next year's dates in
November or December. A red run there is the reminder to add the published
blocks with `addRange()`, not a bug.

## Translations

The widget ships 17 catalogues: Simplified Chinese, English (India), Hindi,
Indonesian, French, Russian (Russia and Belarus), Spanish (Spain and four
Latin-American variants), plus bare-language aliases that widen Qt's locale
fallback. Translations live in `translate/`; see
[`translate/README.md`](translate/README.md) for the workflow and the table
format.

This README is translated as well; the language links at the top of the page
point at those files. They are **machine translations of this document, kept to
one file per language** — the regional catalogue variants (`en_IN`, `ru_BY`,
`es_419` and the four Latin-American Spanish codes) share their language's
README rather than repeating it.

```sh
./translate/merge.sh          # re-extract template.pot after changing i18n() calls
./translate/build.sh          # regenerate .po and compile .mo
./translate/build.sh --check  # CI: fail if any catalogue is out of date
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Every catalogue is machine-generated and has never been reviewed by a native
> speaker.** Each `.po` records this in its header, and its `Language-Team` field
> is still gettext's "no catalogue has been claimed" placeholder. Treat them as a
> starting point, not as finished translation.
>
> **Priority for review: Hindi, Russian and Simplified Chinese** — the languages
> this widget is most likely to be used in, and the ones where an unreviewed
> translation is least acceptable. Everything else is a bonus.

The chosen route for fixing that is **KDE's own translation teams** (decision
D13): it is the only one that yields _reviewed_ translations by people who
actually speak the language. `Messages.sh` in the repository root is already the
entry point KDE's tooling expects, and `translate/README.md` lists the concrete
steps — the main precondition being that the widget has to live in a KDE
repository before the teams can pick it up. Crowdin/Transifex configs are kept
only as a fallback, explicitly marked as never run.
