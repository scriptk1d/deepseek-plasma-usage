## Ratified technical facts (from the user-supplied HAR + live probes)

- Platform endpoints (contract in `docs/state/api-contract.md`):
  `GET /api/v0/users/get_user_summary`, `GET /api/v0/usage/by_api_key/amount`,
  `GET /api/v0/usage/by_api_key/cost`. Auth = `authorization: Bearer <session token>` only.
- Platform API returns **HTTP 200 for auth failures** with `code:40003` → must
  branch on JSON `code`.
- Official `/user/balance` works with the supplied test key.

## SUPERSEDED

- **D39** — classic branch protection on `main`. Replaced by the repository rulesets
  in D43, which also cover tags and admit no bypass. `docs/state/protection.json`
  is kept as history, not as configuration.
- **D4 (the id) and D7 (the catalogue domain)** — `org.deepseek.plasma.usage` and
  `plasma_applet_org.deepseek.plasma.usage` are replaced by `sh.marble.deepseek.usage`
  in D73, which carries the domain with it. The old namespace read as DeepSeek's own
  organisation; the new one is the publisher's. The two `docs/plan-*.md` files still
  show the old id and are left as they were written.

### Correction (recorded, not hidden)

Earlier in this session I described **WebLate** as the tool KDE uses. The KDE
wiki page I later read states that KDE stores translations in **SVN** and that
translators use **Lokalize**; it does not document WebLate. That claim was
unsupported and has been corrected in `translate/README.md` and `README.md`.
The `Infrastructure/Scripty` wiki page is empty, so the exact current procedure
for getting a project picked up by KDE's translation automation is **not
verified** and is flagged as such.

### Verified during round 3 (level 1)

- The KDE `Messages.sh` convention was taken from a real, installed KDE file
  (`/usr/share/sddm/themes/breeze/Messages.sh`: `$XGETTEXT … -o $podir/<domain>.pot`)
  rather than from memory.
- Our `Messages.sh` was **smoke-tested** with a simulated `$XGETTEXT`/`$podir`
  environment: it produces a pot containing the **same 70 msgids** as
  `translate/merge.sh` (`diff` of the sorted msgid sets is empty), named
  `plasma_applet_org.deepseek.plasma.usage.pot` — i.e. the two extraction paths
  agree and cannot drift.

### Verified during round 4 (level 1)

- Column alignment was checked on-device with the platform mock:
  `Today`/`Last 30 days` now sit directly over their figures, and the per-key
  figures line up down the column.
- The peak countdown was checked **against the schedule, not just for
  presence**: at Sat 2026-09-26 22:27 UTC the widget read `26:33:05`, i.e.
  1 d 2 h 33 m, and an independent node computation of `msUntilChange` gave the
  same value with a next change of **Mon 2026-09-28 01:00 UTC** — the first peak
  window of the next weekday, as the documented rule requires.
- `KCoreAddons.Format.formatSpelloutDuration` was read back on-device for both
  a multi-day span (`1 day and 2 hours`) and a peak-window span
  (`3 hours and 15 minutes`).
- A real QML error was caught and fixed this way: assigning the `font` group and
  then `font.bold` on the same object is invalid
  ("Property has already been assigned a value"), which the per-key grid hit
  first.
- `node --test` is now 36 assertions (26 + 10 peak). One of the new tests was
  itself wrong at first — it asserted that the China-date conversion changes the
  answer, and checking that revealed it cannot, because both peak windows end
  before 16:00 UTC. The test now checks the conversion directly and says why.

### Verified during round 5 (level 1)

- `node --test` → **42/42** (26 api/format/wallet + 16 peak); `qmllint` → 0;
  `./translate/build.sh --check` → 0 (17 catalogues × 74 strings);
  `./install.sh` → 0. Re-run after the final documentation edit.
- The three states were **rendered on-device** rather than assumed: peak (red dot,
  `Peak`, countdown), off-peak (green dot), and unknown (neutral dot, `Unknown`,
  no countdown — the value that exposed the `null`-to-`0` coercion).

### Verified during round 6 (level 1)

- The seven README files were checked programmatically rather than by eye: the
  extracted fenced-code regions are byte-identical to the English file's
  (`diff` empty), the identifier counts match, and every relative link target
  resolves on disk.
- The language-navigation block is byte-identical across all seven files.
- Both workflows parse under `yaml.safe_load`, and the CI file's four job ids are
  as documented.
- The screenshots were captured and then **read back**: the popup shows the
  aligned `Today`/`Last 30 days` columns, `Highest $1.29`, the `Off-peak` row with
  a green dot and its countdown, and no masked key id (D19).

| D29 | Each README omits **its own language** from the language-navigation row                            | The badge row lists the other six files, never the one being read.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | A link to the page you are already on is a no-op that reads like a mistake, and its absence doubles as a "you are here".                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | permanent |
| D30 | Every translated README carries a popup **rendered in its own language**; the panel chip is shared | `docs/images/rich-mode[.<tag>].png`, `<tag>` the BCP-47 spelling of the locale (`zh_CN` → `zh-CN`), English unsuffixed; `docs/images/panel-mode.png` is used by all seven.                                                                                                                                       | A translated page that illustrates itself with an English UI is a poor example, and it hides real layout differences: Hindi and Russian strings run much longer than the English ones. The chip is _not_ duplicated because in the data state it renders only the formatted number — the seven per-locale chips came out **pixel-identical** (`compare -metric AE` = 0), and seven copies would imply a difference that does not exist. A chip in the unconfigured or error state does carry text and would have to become per-locale. | permanent |
| D31 | Screenshot capture is a **committed, self-restoring script**                                       | `tests/capture-screenshots.sh`: starts the mock, redirects `PLATFORM_BASE`, backs up and fakes the KWallet token, runs the compact pass, then forces `preferredRepresentation` and runs the popup pass, re-installing between them. A `trap` restores both source files, the wallet and the install on any exit. | One installed copy can prefer only one representation, so two passes are unavoidable; and 14 images will go stale again, so the recipe belongs in the repository rather than in a chat log.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | permanent |

### Verified during round 7 (level 1)

- All eight images exist, and every popup was read back rather than assumed: the
  UI, the peak/off-peak row and the token table are translated in each language,
  and the two longest (Hindi, Russian) still fit without the table being pushed off
  the bottom.
- The per-locale chips were generated and then dropped: they were
  **pixel-identical** to the English one (`compare -metric AE` = 0), because only
  the locale-independent number is rendered. A differing `md5sum` had suggested
  otherwise; it was PNG encoding, not pixels. Seven files that differ only in
  encoding would imply a difference that does not exist.
- Each badge row holds six entries and never the file's own name; the fenced code
  blocks remain byte-identical to the English file's, and every referenced image
  path resolves.

| D32 | The usage window is **periodDays days, not periodDays+1**           | `Api.usageWindow(now, days)` = `{ start: daysAgo(now, days - 1), end: startOfToday(now) + 86400 }`; `ApiClient` only consumes it.                                                                                                                                                                 | `end` is tomorrow's local midnight, so starting at `daysAgo(now, days)` asked for 31 days while the widget said "Last 30 days": spend on the oldest day was folded into every period figure. The recorded live probe (`start=1787886000` = 2026-08-28, `end=1790478000`) is a 30-day window and matches the platform page, so the probe is the reference the code now obeys. | permanent |
| D33 | The **popup shows exact counts**; the panel chip stays compact      | `Fmt.grouped()` for the token and request figures in `FullRepresentation`; `Fmt.tokens()`/`compactNumber()` remain for the panel metric. Also routes the Requests rows through `shown()`, which they had bypassed.                                                                                | `297,270,684` rendered as `297.3M` cannot be checked against the platform's page, which is the whole point of the detailed view. The chip has to fit a number into a panel and is not where anyone compares figures. The bypass was a privacy-mode leak: "Hide all amounts" hid every other figure but left request counts readable.                                         | permanent |
| D34 | The dev mock is a **snapshot of a real account**, and checks itself | `tests/mock-platform-server.mjs` pins the totals in its header, derives per-key/per-day figures with a largest-remainder split, and `--check` recomputes them; `api.test.mjs` pushes the payloads through `parseEnvelope`/`parseSummary`/`aggregateUsage` and asserts the platform's own figures. | Invented mock numbers are why the screenshots could not be validated against anything. Real ones make every screenshot and every regression test checkable by hand, and `--check` keeps the snapshot consistent instead of trusting a comment that says it is.                                                                                                               | permanent |
| D35 | The sparkline places bars **by date**, not by array index           | The Canvas computes `(bucket.time - windowStart) / 86400` against the requested window, which `ApiClient` exposes as `windowStart`/`windowEnd`.                                                                                                                                                   | Spacing by index is invisible while every day has spend and wrong when few do: four recent days were drawn across a whole month, which reads as steady month-long usage. The platform's own chart leaves the empty days empty.                                                                                                                                               | permanent |

### Findings recorded, not changed

- **`money()` shows 3 decimals below $1**, where the platform shows 2. Kept: for
  this account it only affects values the platform does not display (per-key
  costs), and it avoids `$0.00` for genuinely tiny amounts. Worth revisiting if a
  _card_ value ever falls below a dollar.
- **The platform's own page is inconsistent by 2 cents**: its four day bars
  (0.29 + 1.14 + 0.75 + 1.05) sum to $3.23 while its card says $3.25, because the
  tooltips round each day to cents. The mock keeps full precision so its parts sum
  to its whole, which is the property the widget's totals rely on.
- **The `tz` sign rests on the recorded probe.** `tzOffsetSeconds()` sends the UTC
  offset in seconds (-10800 for GMT-3), the probe's buckets come back at local
  midnights, and its `start`/`end` match `usageWindow()`. That is self-consistent,
  but the raw probe command was not kept, so a live re-run with a working session
  token is still the only way to be certain.

### Verified during round 8 (level 1)

- `node tests/mock-platform-server.mjs --check` → cost 3.2500, requests 1325,
  tokens 297270684, "consistent".
- The pipeline test asserts those same three figures **after** `parseEnvelope` →
  `parseSummary` → `aggregateUsage`, plus today's bucket at $1.0602 and that every
  bucket is day-aligned to the window.
- The popup was read back: `$6.74`, no bonus line, `$1.06` today, `$3.25` period
  and lifetime, `Highest $1.14`, and `295,784,330` in + `1,486,354` out = the
  platform's `297,270,684`, with `1,325` requests.
- The sparkline was read back: four bars, all within the last five of thirty slots.
- Full gauntlet green: `qmllint` 0, `node --test` 47/47, `--check` 0,
  `./install.sh` 0.
- **Not verified:** a live platform response — the session token in KWallet is
  empty, so the reconciliation runs against a fixture built from the account's own
  usage page rather than a fresh fetch.

| D36 | Numbers and money follow **CLDR per locale**, from an explicit table | `format.js` gains `NUMBER_FORMATS` (separators, grouping style, sign position and its gap) and `formatNumber`/`money` that take a locale; `Qt.locale().name` is read once in `main.qml` and passed to the three formatters. | The UI was English-formatted everywhere: `1,234,567.89`, sign always first. Everything the widget ships breaks at least one rule — `1.234.567,89` and `1 234 567,89` for separators, `12,34,567.89` for Indian grouping, `US$`/`$US`/`USD` for the sign and where it goes. Separators are locale data, not text, so they do not belong in the catalogue. | permanent |
| D37 | The table is **transcribed from ICU and asserted locale by locale**  | The provenance one-liner is in the `format.js` header; `tests/format.test.mjs` carries a 19-locale table of expected number and money strings, with the separator and gap characters as escapes.                            | Whether the gap is `U+202F`, `U+00A0` or a plain space is invisible in a screenshot and impossible to remember; a bad transcription has to fail the suite, not merely look odd.                                                                                                                                                                          | permanent |

### Findings recorded, not changed

- **Bare `es` follows Spain, not Latin America** (ICU: `1.234.567,89 US$`), the
  opposite of what D9 assumed when it refused to alias a bare `es` catalogue. Only
  reachable when the locale really is plain `es`.
- **`money()` still shows three decimals below $1** where CLDR's currency pattern
  is two. That is now visible in the screenshots (a French per-key cost reads
  `0,885 $US`), making it the one remaining CLDR deviation on a card-level value.
  Left alone again deliberately: it is a product choice that avoids `$0.00` for
  tiny amounts, not a missing separator, and changing it moves every small figure.
- **The compact panel form keeps Latin K/M/B suffixes** (documented on
  `compactNumber`). CLDR's compact forms have their own divisors and suffixes per
  locale (`zh` 3亿, `hi` 29.7 क॰, `ru` 297,3 млн, `fr` 297,3 k) — a table of its
  own for the one metric that uses it, the panel's token count.

### Verified during round 9 (level 1)

- A dev-only script (`docs/state/verify-format.mjs`, since deleted) compared the
  table against `Intl` for 21 locale spellings × 4 numbers × 3 currencies:
  **168 values, 0 mismatches**. The generic symbol list differs from ICU's English
  names by design (RUB, SEK, PLN, HUF, ... render as the sign, not the code).
- `format.test.mjs` pins the same expectations a locale at a time, including the
  no-break and narrow-no-break characters as escapes.
- Screenshots read back: `fr-FR` (`6,74 $US`, `151 220 605`), `hi-IN`
  (`29,57,84,330`), `zh-CN` (`US$6.74`).
- Full gauntlet green: `qmllint` 0, `node --test` 51/51, `--check` 0,
  `./install.sh` 0.

Plasma reads `KPlugin.Version` for the widget's About, npm and `gh release` read `package.json`, so both have to be right.                                                                                                                                                                                      | permanent                            |

The generated gettext files must not be rewritten or `translate/build.sh --check` would fail.

### Correction (recorded, not hidden)

D25 claimed the `qmllint` CI job needed no KDE packages because _"qmllint on Qt 6
resolves no imports"_. That was tested against the Qt 6.11 installed here and does
not hold for the Qt 6.4 that Ubuntu 24.04 ships: it reports the unresolvable
`org.kde.*` imports as warnings and exits non-zero, the same status as a parse
error, so the first CI run failed for a reason that was not a defect. The claim was
wrong, not merely incomplete, and D41 is what replaces it.

### Verified during round 10 (level 1)

- The repository exists and the first push landed: `main` at `3402632`, five check
  runs green (`Unit tests (node)`, `Prettier`, `Translations up to date`,
  `QML syntax`, `Pack the plasmoid`).
- The first run **failed** on `QML syntax` and was read rather than re-run: the log
  showed `Failed to import org.kde.plasma.configuration` and exit 255. That is what
  produced D41 and the correction above; the second run is green.
- `gh repo view` reports `visibility: PUBLIC`, `has_wiki: false`,
  `licenseInfo: gpl-2.0`; the six topics are set; `mergeCommitAllowed` is false
  while squash and rebase remain enabled.
- The protection is read back from the API: five required contexts, zero required
  approvals and a PR requirement both present, `required_linear_history` true,
  force pushes and deletions false, admins not enforced.
- Locally: `npm test` 54/54, `translate/build.sh --check` 0, `prettier --check`
  clean, `tests/lint-qml.sh` exits 0 on this Plasma 6 machine.

| D43 | Branch and tag protection are **repository rulesets**, not classic protection               | `main` = ruleset 24055635 (`target: branch`, `~DEFAULT_BRANCH`); `release tags` = 24055636 (`target: tag`, `refs/tags/v*`). Bodies are `docs/state/ruleset-main.json` and `docs/state/ruleset-tags.json`, applied with `gh api -X PUT .../rulesets`. D39's classic protection was deleted, so there is one source of truth. `bypass_actors` is empty, and the API reports `current_user_can_bypass: never`. | Classic protection covers branches only, so protecting a tag pattern needs a ruleset anyway; keeping both would be two sources of truth for one rule. Classic also lets an admin bypass, which makes the branch only as protected as the maintainer's own discipline. The cost of removing the bypass is that a wedged check is fixed by editing the ruleset rather than by an admin override.                         | permanent                                                 |

The dev tree still runs on contributors' machines and in CI, so it is worth auditing. It fails on `high` and above only: a `moderate` advisory in a dev-only tool has no path to anyone using the widget, and there is nothing in the runtime tree to upgrade in response.                          | permanent                                                 |

### Correction (recorded, not hidden)

D39 described `main` as protected by **classic branch protection**, applied from
`docs/state/protection.json` with `PUT /repos/.../branches/main/protection`, and
recorded that "admins are exempt". That was accurate when it was written and is no
longer true of the repository: the classic protection has been deleted in favour of
the two rulesets in D43, and `GET .../branches/main/protection` now answers
`404 Branch not protected`. The admin exemption went with it — both rulesets report
`current_user_can_bypass: never`. `docs/state/protection.json` is history, not
configuration; D43 is the configuration.

A second, smaller correction: D39's table row also claimed the five CI checks were
required, which was true, but `Dependency audit` and CodeQL's `Analyze JavaScript`
were added as required checks in the same round as the jobs themselves, so the count
moved from five to seven (both are verified below).

### Verified during round 11 (level 1)

- The `main` ruleset **refuses a direct push**, re-proved first-hand in this round
  rather than carried over: an empty commit pushed to `main` returned
  `GH013 ... push declined due to repository rule violations`, naming both
  `Changes must be made through a pull request` and `5 of 5 required status checks
are expected`. `git reset --hard origin/main` restored the tree (untracked work
  survived; the three files that had been edited in place did not, and were
  rewritten).
- The **tag ruleset was proved with a real `v0.0.0-probe` tag**, not asserted:
  creating it pushed cleanly (exit 0), deleting it was refused with
  `GH013 ... Cannot delete this tag` (exit 1), and force-moving it was refused with
  `Cannot update this protected ref` (exit 1). Deleting the _same_ tag while the
  ruleset was set to `disabled` succeeded — so the refusal was the ruleset, not a
  permission or a typo. The tag and the temporary disable were both removed
  afterwards; `git ls-remote --tags origin` is empty again.
- The ruleset **test body matches the live API**: `docs/state/ruleset-tags.json`'s
  `refs/tags/v*` is what `GET .../rulesets/24055636` returns, and the same pattern is
  what `release.yml` triggers on, which is now asserted by `tests/version.test.mjs`.
- `npm audit` reports **0 advisories at every level**, so the new `Dependency audit`
  job passes on the current tree. `npm audit --omit=dev` was checked and also reports
  zero — which is precisely why it would have been a useless gate.
- `scripts/social-preview.sh` is idempotent and writes 1280x640 at 239,347 bytes,
  well under GitHub's 1 MB limit. `gh repo view` still reports
  `usesCustomOpenGraphImage: false`: uploading the PNG is the one step no API
  performs.
- Repository settings read back from the API: `visibility: PUBLIC`,
  `has_wiki: false`, `has_projects: false`, `has_discussions: true`,
  `has_issues: true`, `allow_auto_merge: true`, `delete_branch_on_merge: true`,
  `allow_merge_commit: false` with squash and rebase enabled, squash title/message
  `PR_TITLE`/`PR_BODY`, topics `deepseek kde plasma plasmoid qt i18n`, and secret
  scanning with push protection enabled (GitHub's default for a new public
  repository, confirmed rather than assumed).
- `scripts/release-notes.sh` was exercised against the real changelog: it prints the
  `[0.1.0]` section, exits 1 for a version with no section, and exits 2 with no
  argument at all.
- The release workflow's **tag guard was proved by negative test**, which matters
  because it is the one gate whose failure mode is publishing a release that should
  not exist. `release.yml` arrived in a pull request, so a throwaway
  `v0.0.0-probe` tag was pushed at that pull request's head: the run failed at
  `Check the tag against the version` with
  `tag v0.0.0-probe does not match package.json version 0.1.0`, every later step —
  `Publish` included — was skipped, and `gh release list` stayed empty. The probe tag
  was then removed. A `push` of a tag runs the workflow from the tagged commit, which
  is what made this testable before the merge; `schedule` and `release` events would
  each have needed the workflow on the default branch first.
- The **final ruleset state was read back** from the API after the pull request
  merged, and it is what D43 claims: seven required contexts — `Unit tests (node)`,
  `Prettier`, `Translations up to date`, `QML syntax`, `Pack the plasmoid`,
  `Dependency audit`, `Analyze JavaScript` — `allowed_merge_methods` narrowed to
  `squash` and `rebase` so the rule cannot offer a merge-commit button that the
  linear-history rule would reject, `bypass_actors: []`, and
  `current_user_can_bypass: "never"`. Requiring the two new gates only became possible
  after they had reported on a pull request, since a required context that no run has
  produced leaves a pull request permanently unmergeable.
- `require_extra_approval_for_unattributed_changes` is left at `true`, which is what
  GitHub defaults it to when the field is omitted. It is inert here — PR #2 merged
  with that rule active and zero approvals — so it was not worth disabling a safety
  default to work around. Revisit if a second maintainer or a fork pull request ever
  makes it bite.
- **Private vulnerability reporting was `enabled: false`**, which meant the only
  reporting route `SECURITY.md` offers — the private advisory form it links to — was
  closed to everyone except an administrator. Reading the repository's own configuration
  back is what found it; nothing about writing the file would have. It is now enabled
  (`PUT /repos/.../private-vulnerability-reporting`), and D49 records it as part of the
  policy rather than as an optional extra.
- The first CodeQL analysis found **five alerts, all in dev tooling** and none in the
  shipped widget: three `js/unused-local-variable` notes (`ROOT` and `DOMAIN` in
  `translate/generate.mjs`, `dayIndex` in `tests/mock-platform-server.mjs`) and two
  `js/file-system-race` warnings where the generator checked `existsSync` and then wrote
  the file. The dead constants are deleted and the check-then-read is now a
  `readIfExists` helper treating `ENOENT` as absent — the same behaviour with no window
  between the check and the use. Cleared rather than accepted, because an alert list
  that is never empty is a list nobody reads.
- Open item, not yet exercised: **CodeQL on a pull request from a fork.** The
  `Analyze JavaScript` job needs `security-events: write`, which a fork pull request
  is granted for code scanning but which nothing here has tested. If a fork pull
  request is ever wedged on that check, the fix is a `pull_request` path filter or
  removing the context from the required list.

### Verified during round 12 (level 1)

- **Two releases shipped, both from a signed tag.** `v0.1.0` published with the
  `.plasmoid` (93,548 bytes) and notes taken from the changelog; GitHub reports the tag
  `verified: true, reason: valid`. `v0.1.1` follows this round. The `v0.1.0` push is the
  first time `release.yml` ran to completion, having been proved before the merge only
  by the negative test in round 11.
- **An unsigned tag over a signed commit was accepted; over an unsigned commit it was
  refused** with `GH013 ... Commits must have verified signatures`. This is what D51
  records, and it is the opposite of what the simple reading of the rule name suggests.
- **The bypass drops the review and not the checks.** With the reviewer gate enabled,
  PR #6 was `BLOCKED` / `REVIEW_REQUIRED` with all seven checks green, and the REST
  merge succeeded (`"merged": true`). Repeated with a deliberately failing `Prettier`
  check, the same call answered `405 ... Required status check "Prettier" is failing`.
- **The ruleset bypass makes no difference to a direct push.** With
  `bypass_mode: always` on the reviewer ruleset, an empty commit pushed straight to
  `main` was still refused, naming `Changes must be made through a pull request` and
  `7 of 7 required status checks`.
- **`require_code_owner_review` was measured both ways.** With zero required
  approvals it changes nothing at all; with one, the same pull request went from
  `CLEAN` to `BLOCKED` / `REVIEW_REQUIRED`.
- Every ruleset refusal above was made with a **control in the same shape**: `creation`
  was accepted as a branch rule while `branch_name_pattern`, `max_file_size` and
  `merge_queue` were refused, so the mechanism was never the variable under test.
- The regenerated images were read back per locale, and the figures reconcile by hand:
  `In 158,303,127 + Out 795,492 = 159,098,619` tokens, `Cached` is the fixture's 98% of
  `In`, and Hindi renders `15,83,03,127` with Indian digit grouping. `--check` recomputes
  cost 4.6200, requests 910 and 159,098,619 tokens from the same tables.
- Local gauntlet after every commit: `prettier --check` 0, `node --test` **55/55**,
  `tests/lint-qml.sh` 0, `translate/build.sh --check` 0, `mock --check` 0, `./install.sh` 0,
  `npm audit --audit-level=high` 0.

Printing the shape answers both without putting anyone's balance in a transcript.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | permanent |
| D62 | `MAX_FILE_SIZE`-style limits are **megabytes**, and an unavailable rule is recorded as unavailable | Not a code decision but a contract fact worth keeping: `max_file_size` takes megabytes (1-100), and `branch_name_pattern`, `max_file_size`, `file_path_restriction` and `merge_queue` are refused on a user-owned repository while `creation` in the same shape is accepted.                          | The control is the point. Without a rule that does work, "Invalid rule" reads as "we asked wrongly" and the next person retries it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | permanent |

### Verified during round 13 (level 1)

- **Against the live API, not the mock.** No header → `40002 Missing Token`; the wrapper →
  `40003 Authorization Failed (invalid token)`; the inner value → `code 0` with a full
  `biz_data`. Both usage endpoints with the widget's own URL went from `biz_code 1
INVALID_PARAM` to `biz_code 0` once `start` was derived from `end`.
- The three real responses, run through the widget's own parsing and aggregation, report
  days with activity, keys listed and a finite token total: **rich mode would render**.
- The DST regression test was written first and **failed on the old arithmetic**
  (`start is not a day boundary for tz -10800`, off by 3600; and `1787889600` where the
  platform sends `1787886000`), then passed on the new one.
- `Api.normalizeSessionToken` is covered for the storage wrapper, a quoted copy, an
  escaped quoted copy, a whole `Bearer …` header, surrounding whitespace, and for the
  cases it must leave alone (`{not json`, `{"value":42}`, `1234`, `true`, `""`).
- The wire header was read rather than assumed: the mock's `--echo-auth` shows
  `Bearer <the bare token>` from the fixed build and `Bearer {"value":…}` from the old
  one, on all three requests, with no QML error.
- An `[Unreleased]` release was **not** cut, and the version stayed at 0.1.1.

| D63 | The CI jobs are **runnable locally**, in two sizes                                          | `scripts/gauntlet.sh` (all of it) and `--fast` (the subset); `scripts/hooks/pre-commit` and `pre-push` call them; `scripts/install-hooks.sh` sets `core.hooksPath` at the tracked directory and can unset it.                                                                                                                                          | A check that exists only in CI is a check nobody runs: the failure is discovered after a push, in a browser tab, minutes later. Keeping the hooks **tracked** rather than in `.git/hooks` is what makes them reviewable and keeps them in step with the workflows. CodeQL stays out — it needs the CodeQL bundle — and is named as the one gap rather than quietly omitted.       | permanent                                                 |
| D64 | `template.pot` is **checked, not assumed**, against the sources                             | `translate/merge.sh --check` re-extracts into a temp directory and diffs against the committed pot, ignoring `POT-Creation-Date`. Wired into `npm run check:pot`, the gauntlet, the hooks and the `Translations up to date` CI job.                                                                                                                    | `build.sh --check` proved the catalogues match the tables, and `generate.mjs` refuses to build with a table entry missing — but nothing connected the _sources_ to the tables. An `i18n()` call added without re-extracting is a string missing from every one of the 17 shipped catalogues, and the only thing that would have reported it is a user seeing English.             | permanent                                                 |
| D65 | `metadata.json` is **checked against KDE's documentation and against its own consequences** | `tests/metadata.test.mjs`: the documented `KPlugin` keys, `KPackageStructure`, a `Category` from KDE's list (an unknown one is silently ignored), well-formed `Name[xx]`/`Description[xx]`, no `metadata.desktop`, and the plugin id agreeing with `translate/build.sh`, `install.sh` and every compiled `.mo` filename. `KPlugin.BugReportUrl` added. | The id appears in five places that must agree, and a rename in one shows up as a widget with no translations or none in the list at all — never as an error. The key set was derived by comparing this file with the 14 plasmoids installed on this machine: all ten universal keys were already present, and `BugReportUrl` was the one conventional key missing (13 of the 14). | permanent                                                 |
| D66 | The i18n route is **re-verified against KDE's own documentation**                           | Read `Widget Properties`, `Templates` and `Translations / i18n`. Confirmed: `i18n()` always double-quoted (single quotes are ignored by the extractor — none exist here), the KDE keyword set including `i18np`, the domain `plasma_applet_<Id>`, and `contents/locale/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/<domain>.mo`.                                              | Most of it already matched. What the reading changed: `merge.sh` now checks itself (D64), the plugin id is cross-checked (D65), and one thing is recorded as **unverified**: whether KDE's extraction picks up `Name`/`Description` from a `metadata.json`, which is how the installed plasmoids have `Name[xx]` at all. `Messages.sh` extracts QML and JS only.                  | permanent, the open question until confirmed on #kde-i18n |

### Verified during round 14 (level 1)

- `scripts/gauntlet.sh` passes end to end: **66/66** tests, prettier, qmllint, the
  catalogue check, the new template check, the audit, the fixture self-check and the
  package build (95,163 bytes).
- Both hooks were **negative-tested**, not assumed: with an unformatted file staged,
  `git commit` was refused (exit 1, HEAD unchanged) and `git push --dry-run` was refused
  with only the `Pack the plasmoid`-side of the run remaining to report. Both were run
  with the hooks installed through `scripts/install-hooks.sh`.
- `translate/merge.sh --check` was negative-tested too: a real `i18n()` call added to
  `CompactRepresentation.qml` made it exit 1 and print the missing string against the
  pot; restoring the file made it pass again.
- `metadata.json`'s key set was read off the 14 plasmoids in
  `/usr/share/plasma/plasmoids/` rather than guessed. `X-Plasma-API-Minimum-Version`,
  `KPlugin.Website` and `License: "GPL-2.0+"` are all what KDE's own widgets use (12 of
  the 14 for the licence string), and `X-Plasma-RootPath` turned out to name _another_
  package, so it is deliberately absent.
- `npm test` now also covers `metadata.json` (5 cases) and the DST window (2), so the
  suite is 66 rather than 55.

| D67 | The widget is described **in every locale it ships**, not only in every README                                 | `Description[<locale>]` for the six translated READMEs, plus `[es]`, `[fr]`, `[hi]`, `[id]` and `[ru]`. `tests/metadata.test.mjs` requires an exact entry per README and a reachable one — exact, or by the language Qt falls back to — per locale in `translate/LINGUAS`, with `en_IN` exempt as the English base. | Qt resolves a locale by shortening it, so `es_CL` finds `Description[es]` and `ru_BY` finds `Description[ru]`: one entry per language covers the region-tagged aliases we ship. Without them an `es_CL` user has a Spanish interface and an English line in the widget list, which is the wrong half to leave untranslated. This is the same territory as D9's bare-`es` caution, which is about catalogue _text_ with real regional differences; one sentence describing balance and usage has none, and the alternative is English. | permanent |
| D68 | The version is written in **three** places, and `scripts/bump-version.sh` moves all three at once              | `package.json`, `metadata.json`'s `KPlugin.Version` and the newest `CHANGELOG.md` heading. The script refuses a version that is not SemVer, one that is not greater than the current one, and one with an empty `[Unreleased]`; then it runs the guard and prints the tag command.                                  | `tests/version.test.mjs` already failed on a drift and named the field, so the "at the very least a check" half of the request was met before it was asked. But a check tells you _after_ the same value has been written in three files and one was missed. The failure mode is the forgetting, so make it one command — and refuse the two ways a release goes wrong on the way (`0.1.1` again, or a tag with nothing to read).                                                                                                     | permanent |
| D69 | `metadata.json`'s formatting belongs to Prettier even when the file is edited outside the repository's tooling | Returned to four-space indentation; `KPlugin.BugReportUrl` now points at the issue chooser, which is the URL that offers the issue forms.                                                                                                                                                                           | An editor that reformats JSON to two spaces changes nothing semantically and fails the `Prettier` job — which now also runs in the pre-commit hook, so this surfaces as a blocked commit instead of a red CI run. `.editorconfig` already asked for four, so the remaining fix is in the editor's own settings.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | permanent |

### Verified during round 15 (level 1)

- **Every shipped locale is covered by name.** Of the 17 catalogues in `translate/LINGUAS`,
  11 resolve to an exact entry and 5 by their language (`es_419`, `es_AR`, `es_CL`,
  `es_CU`, `es_MX` via `[es]`; `ru_BY` via `[ru]`); `en_IN` is the English base by
  design. Nothing falls back to English that should not.
- **`bump-version.sh` was exercised, not just written.** It moved all three files to
  `0.2.0` together and the guard passed; the working tree was then restored, so no
  release was cut. It refused `banana` (exit 1), the current `0.1.1` (exit 1), a lower
  `0.0.9` (exit 1), no argument (usage, exit 2), and an emptied `[Unreleased]` (exit 1,
  with the reason quoted).
- **The drift check was demonstrated.** With `metadata.json` set to `9.9.9` against
  `package.json`'s `0.1.1`, `tests/version.test.mjs` failed with
  `AssertionError: metadata.json KPlugin.Version — actual '9.9.9', expected '0.1.1'`.
  The check runs in the `Unit tests (node)` job and in the pre-commit hook.
- The README-per-language rule and the catalogue-per-locale rule were both made to
  fail first: the first run reported `Description[en_IN] or Description[en], for
catalogue en_IN`, which is what exposed the `\b`-does-not-break-at-underscore
  mistake in the exemption.
- `metadata.json` passes the `Prettier` check again, so the two-space reformat that
  arrived with the edit is gone.

### Verified during round 2 (live, level 1)

- The in-package catalogue path works: a 3-string probe `.mo` at
  `contents/locale/es_CL/LC_MESSAGES/…` rendered translated strings under
  `LANG=es_CL.utf8` while untranslated strings stayed English.
- The domain is `plasma_applet_` + plugin id — confirmed against 3477
  `plasma_applet_*.mo` files in `/usr/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/` and
  `Plasma::Applet::translationDomain()` in `libPlasma.so`.
- All 17 catalogues render correctly on-device (screenshots in the i18n
  commit message thread); Russian's three-form plural resolves correctly for
  n=30 (`за 30 дней`, form 2), and the Hindi/French plural forms resolve too.
- `translate/build.sh --check` was negative-tested: it fails on a hand-edited
  `.po` and on a hand-edited `.mo`, and passes when clean.

Round 16 — 2026-09-27 (a login window was asked for, investigated, and refused)

| D70 | **No username/password login window.** The pasted session token stays, and the settings page gains an “Open platform.deepseek.com” button and a “How to get it” hint. | The user asked for a DeepSeek login window storing `deepseek-username`/`deepseek-password` in KWallet “if possible”. It is not possible: the login routes live under `/auth-api/v0/*` and every one of them answers `HTTP 202` with `x-amzn-waf-action: challenge` — an AWS WAF bot check that only executes in a real browser. Passing it needs JavaScript, WebCrypto and an `aws-waf-token` cookie, and the challenge script’s own path is challenged too, so the loop cannot even be started. | Not a guess and not a shortcut: an A/B control (`POST /auth-api/v0/zzz` reaches the origin and 404s while `POST /auth-api/v0/users/login` is challenged in the same instant) proves the check is scoped to the real auth routes and unconditional. A password in KWallet with no endpoint that accepts it is pure liability, so none is stored. Opening the site and naming the `userToken` entry is the maximum the platform permits a non-browser client to do. | permanent, while the bot check stands         |
| D71 | The usage window’s ceiling is **31 days**, held in one constant (`Api.MAX_USAGE_DAYS`) that the spinner, the KConfigXT bound and the request all read                 | `contents/config/main.xml` now says `<max>31</max>` (was 90) and `ConfigGeneral.qml`’s spinner is `to: Api.MAX_USAGE_DAYS`; `usageWindow` clamps to it as well, so a value already stored out of range cannot break the widget. `tests/api.test.mjs` fails if the three disagree.                                                                                                                                                                                                                | The platform answers a 31-day window and refuses 32 with `code:0, biz_code:1, biz_msg:"INVALID_PARAM", biz_data:null` (live, 2026-09-27). That reply carries no payload, so it reached the user as “Missing payload” for **every** token entry form — it was never the token. The settings had offered up to 90 days, so the widget could be configured into a request it could never satisfy.                                                                    | permanent, while the platform keeps the limit |
| D72 | The **browser-storage importer (“Detect from browser”) is not built — rejected by the user as too fragile**                                                           | Scoped but never written: a settings button that reads the `userToken` entry from known browsers and writes it to KWallet. Both extraction paths were verified here — Firefox via `sqlite3` on `ls/data.sqlite` (`key='userToken'`, 92 B), and a dependency-free byte scan anchored on the wrapper + token shape (exactly one match, where an unanchored scan hits four unrelated keys) — so it was technically feasible.                                                                        | It would read a live credential out of the user’s browser, depend on undocumented profile layouts and on Firefox’s optional Snappy compression, and stay unverifiable for Chromium (not installed here). The pasted token plus the “How to get it” hint and the Open button from D70 already cover the need, so the fragility is not worth carrying.                                                                                                              | permanent, unless the user revisits           |

### Verified during round 16 (level 1)

- **The login endpoint is not where a first guess looked.** `POST` to
  `…/api/v0/users/login`, `users/login_by_email`, `auth/login` etc. all return
  `404` (`server: elb`, the origin). The real routes are under `/auth-api/v0/`.
- **The bot check is scoped and unconditional, shown with an A/B control.** In the
  same instant, `POST /auth-api/v0/zzz` reached the origin (`404 {"detail":"Not Found"}`)
  while `POST /auth-api/v0/users/login` returned `202`, empty body,
  `x-amzn-waf-action: challenge`. `users/register`, `users/logout` and
  `users/create_pow_challenge` are challenged the same way; a full Firefox
  fingerprint (UA, origin, referer, `sec-fetch-*`) changed nothing, and no
  `aws-waf-token` cookie is ever set.
- **The browser is what passes it, on the user’s own machine.** Firefox’s
  localStorage for `platform.deepseek.com` contains `awswaf_session_storage` and
  `awswaf_token_refresh_timestamp`, and the `userToken` entry itself is present,
  uncompressed (`compression_type 0`, 92 bytes = the `{"value":…,"__version":"0"}`
  wrapper `normalizeSessionToken` already peels). A “Detect from browser” importer
  was scoped from this (it is feasible), then **dropped as too fragile — see D72**.
- **The read path is unaffected and was re-verified live.** With the token in
  KWallet, `build/probe-live.sh` reports `summary ok`, `cost ok`, `amount ok` and
  `RICH MODE WOULD RENDER`.
- **The WAF also guards the read endpoints, but only under a burst.** A rapid probe
  run turned `GET /api/v0/*` into `202 challenge`; it cleared after a ~75 s pause.
  The widget’s 300 s default (30 s floor) does not approach that.
- **The new UI was checked by the full gauntlet**, and the three new strings were
  added to all six authored tables so all 17 catalogues stay complete (77 strings).
- **The “Missing payload” report was a window bug, not a token bug, and was
  reproduced exactly.** With the token from KWallet, `get_user_summary`, `cost` and
  `amount` all answer `200` and parse (`summary ok`, `cost ok`, `amount ok`), and a
  freshly loaded widget logs `status=200 ok=true` for all three — so the credential
  is fine. Two windows are refused with `code:0, biz_code:1 INVALID_PARAM,
biz_data:null`, and both decoded as “Missing payload” before the `biz_code`
  handling landed:
    - **The pre-0.2.0 DST window, which fires right now.** In `America/Santiago`,
      September is the DST transition, and the old formula (start = local midnight N
      days back) produced a 30-day window of 2 674 800 s instead of 2 592 000 s — an
      end that is not a day boundary for the one `tz` sent — which the platform
      refused. `build/probe-old-window.mjs` shows `OLD formula … INVALID_PARAM` beside
      `NEW formula … ok`. **Already fixed in 0.2.0 (D59)**, so a panel instance loaded
      before that upgrade still shows the old text until it is reloaded.
    - **The over-long period, which was not fixed.** 31 days is answered and 32
      refused; the settings offered up to 90. See D71.
- **The limit is length, not age**: a 31-day window ending ten days back is answered
  (`build/probe-shift.mjs`: `31:0`, `31:3`, `31:10` all ok).
- **The session token is not a cookie.** Firefox’s `cookies.sqlite` for
  `platform.deepseek.com` holds only `aws-waf-token` and `smidV2`; the token is in
  local storage. Any “read the cookie” design would therefore have found nothing.
- **The token normalizer was made form-proof.** `build/probe-normalize.mjs` runs
  twelve paste shapes; three (escaped-quote wrapper, its doubly-encoded form, and a
  single-quoted literal) used to pass through untouched and now reduce to the bare
  token. The guards still leave `{"value":42}`, `{"other":"x"}`, `{'other':'x'}`
  and an unterminated paste alone.

| D73 | The plugin id is **`sh.marble.deepseek.usage`**, was `org.deepseek.plasma.usage` (supersedes D4/D7) | `metadata.json` `KPlugin.Id`, `install.sh` `PLUGIN_ID`, `translate/build.sh` `DOMAIN`, `Messages.sh`’s `domain`, the four scripts/docs that name the applet on a command line, and the 17 catalogue filenames under `contents/locale/<locale>/LC_MESSAGES/`. `tests/metadata.test.mjs` already cross-checks the id against `metadata.json`, `install.sh`, `translate/build.sh` and the catalogue filenames, so a miss fails CI rather than shipping. | The namespace should be the publisher’s own reverse-DNS (`marble.sh`, `cassidy@marble.sh`); `org.deepseek.*` reads as DeepSeek’s own organisation, which this widget is not. It is **breaking for an existing install** — the panel widget does not resolve under the old id and must be removed and re-added, losing its per-instance settings, while KWallet entries and account data are untouched — so it ships as 0.3.0, a minor bump because the project is still pre-1.0, with the break stated in the release notes. | permanent |
| D74 | The platform’s opaque refusals are **mapped to an actionable, translated sentence**                 | `Api.failureKind` classifies `code 40002`, `code 40003` and `biz_code 1` in the testable JS; `ApiClient.platformFailure` turns each kind into `i18n()` text (three new strings across the seven locales) and returns `result.msg` unchanged for anything else.                                                                                                                                                                                       | “INVALID_PARAM” and “Authorization Failed (invalid token)” are the platform’s own short codes, written for its own developers, and they name neither the fault nor the fix — the popup is the only place a first-time user looks, and the settings page now knows where the token comes from, so the message can say so. Keeping the raw message for an unrecognised refusal preserves D60’s rule that the platform’s own reason stays visible.                                                                              | permanent |

KWallet entry names stay `deepseek-api-key`/`kimi-api-key`/`zai-api-key` on purpose. | The widget has shown three providers since the Kimi and Z.ai sections landed; a name that promises one of them undersells it and misleads in the widget picker.
