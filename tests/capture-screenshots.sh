#   tests/capture-screenshots.sh              # every language below
#   tests/capture-screenshots.sh zh_CN ru_RU  # just these
#
# For each locale it writes into docs/images/:
#
#   rich-mode[.<tag>].png   the popup, one per locale (FullRepresentation)
#   panel-mode.png          the panel chip, shared by every README
#
# where <tag> is the BCP-47 spelling of the locale (zh_CN -> zh-CN) and is
# omitted for English. The chip is deliberately not per-locale: with data present
# it renders only the formatted number, which is locale-independent, so seven
# pixel-identical files would imply a difference that does not exist. The popup
# is per-locale because its labels really are translated.
#
# Four things happen behind the scenes, all undone on exit by a trap:
#   * tests/mock-platform-server.mjs runs and PLATFORM_BASE points at it, so
#     the screenshots carry fake figures and the real key is never sent
#     anywhere (in "full" mode the official endpoint is only a fallback),
#   * the KWallet session token is backed up and replaced with a fake one,
#     because the widget needs *a* token to enter full mode,
#   * for the popup pass only, main.qml's preferredRepresentation is forced to
#     fullRepresentation — one installed copy can prefer only one, so the two
#     representations need two passes (and two installs),
#   * the widget is re-installed after every edit.
#
# Requires a running Plasma session, ImageMagick and Qt's `plasmawindowed`.
# The window is located by matching _NET_WM_PID, never by title, because the
# title is itself translated.
